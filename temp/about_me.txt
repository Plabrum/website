I'm Phil, a student from England studying Computer Science and Mind Brain Behaviour at Harvard College. I started out at Harvard studying Mechanical Engineering and decided to switch to Computer Science after taking an introductory course and absolutley loving it.
My interests in CS and physics introduced me to Quantum Computing, I am now the vice-president of the Harvard Quantum Computing Association and cofounder of the Quantum Computing Collaborative project with team memebrs at Harvard, MIT, EPFL, and recently UC Davis!
