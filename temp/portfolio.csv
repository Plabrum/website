Quantum Machine Learning,May-19,static/images/projects/quantum_ml.png,As oart of the Engineering Quantum Mechanics (ES170) final project my team built a distanced based classifer for the iris dataset. I built a module that inherited both the qiskit (IBM) and pyquil (Rigetti) circuit construction methods and returned the test results in a unified format. This allowed us to compare the results and runtimes across /the quantum hardware.,https://github.com/plabrum/qml,0
